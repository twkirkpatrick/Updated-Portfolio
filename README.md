# Updated Portfolio
<a target="_blank" href="https://twkirkpatrick.github.io/">Deployed Portfolio</a>

For this assignment, I chose to completely revamp my original portfolio.  To get more practice with jQuery, I dynamically created most of the HTML.  Some new features include a functioning contact modal, CSS and JavaScript animations, as well as a minimalist interface.  As always, I took a mobile-first approach, ensuring that my portfolio is functional, accessible, and appealing on all screen sizes.
